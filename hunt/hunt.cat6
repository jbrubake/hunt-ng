     hhuunntt - a multi-player multi-terminal game

     The object of the game hhuunntt is to kill off the other players.  There are
     no rooms, no treasures, and no monsters.  Instead, you wander around a
     maze, find grenades, trip mines, and shoot down walls and players.  The
     more players you kill before you die, the better your score is.  If the
     --mm flag is given, you enter the game as a monitor (you can see the action
     but you cannot play).

     hhuunntt looks for an active game on the local network.  The location of the
     game may be specified by giving the _h_o_s_t argument.  This presupposes that
     a hunt game is already running on that host:  see huntd(6) for details on
     how to set up a game on a specific host.  If more than one game is found,
     you may pick which game to play in.  If no games are found, hhuunntt will ex-
     it.

     If the --qq flag is given, hhuunntt queries the local network (or specific
     host) and reports on all active games found.  This is useful for shell
     startup scripts, e.g., csh's _._l_o_g_i_n.

     The player name may be specified on the command line by using the --nn op-
     tion.

     The --cc, --ss, and --ff options are for entering the game cloaked, scanning,
     or flying, respectively.

     The --bb option turns off beeping when you reach the typeahead limit.

     The --tt option aids team play by making everyone else on your team appear
     as the team name.  A team name is a single digit to avoid conflicting
     with other characters used in the game.  Use a team name consisting of a
     single space (`to remain on your own.')

     The --pp _p_o_r_t option allows the rendezvous port number to be set.

     The --ww _m_e_s_s_a_g_e option is the only way to send a message to everyone
     else's screen when you start up.  It is most often used to say ``eat
     slime death - NickD's coming in''.

     When you die and are asked if you wish to re-enter the game, there are
     other answers than just yes or no.  You can also reply with a ww to write
     a message before continuing or oo to change how you enter the game
     (cloaked, scanning, or flying).

PPLLAAYYIINNGG HHIINNTTSS
     hhuunntt only works on terminals with at least 24 lines, 80 columns, and cur-
     sor addressing.  The screen is divided in to 3 areas.  On the right hand
     side is the status area.  It shows damage sustained, charges remaining,
     who's in the game, who's scanning (the `*' in front of the name), who's
     cloaked (the `+' in front of the name), and other players' scores.  The
     rest of the screen is taken up by your map of the maze.  The 24th line is
     used for longer messages that don't fit in the status area.

     hhuunntt uses the same keys to move as vi(1) does, i.e., hh, jj, kk, and ll for
     left, down, up, right, respectively.  To change which direction you're
     facing in the maze, use the upper case version of the movement key (i.e.,
     HHJJKKLL).  You can only fire or throw things in the direction you're facing.

     Other commands are:
     ff or 11      Fire a bullet (Takes 1 charge)
     gg or 22      Throw grenade (Takes 9 charges)
     FF or 33      Throw satchel charge (Takes 25 charges)
     GG or 44      Throw bomb (Takes 49 charges)
     55           Throw big bomb (Takes 81 charges)
     66           Throw even bigger bomb (Takes 121 charges)
     77           Throw even more big bomb (Takes 169 charges)
     88           Throw even more bigger bomb (Takes 225 charges)
     99           Throw very big bomb (Takes 289 charges)
     00           Throw very, very big bomb (Takes 361 charges)
     @@           Throw biggest bomb (Takes 441 charges)
     oo           Throw small slime (Takes 5 charges)
     OO           Throw big slime (Takes 10 charges)
     pp           Throw bigger slime (Takes 15 charges)
     PP           Throw biggest slime (Takes 20 charges)
     ss           Scan (show where other players are) (Takes 1 charge)

     Other helpful hints:
     ++oo   You can only fire in the direction you are facing.
     ++oo   You can only fire three shots in a row before the gun must cool off.
     ++oo   Shots move 5 times faster than you do.
     ++oo   To stab someone, you face that player and move at them.
     ++oo   Stabbing does 2 points worth of damage and shooting does 5 points.
     ++oo   Slime does 5 points of damage each time it hits.
     ++oo   You start with 15 charges and get 5 more every time a player enters
         or re-enters.
     ++oo   Grenade explosions cover a 3 by 3 area, each larger bomb cover a cor-
         respondingly larger area (ranging from 5 by 5 to 21 by 21).  All ex-
         plosions are centered around the square the shot hits and do the most
         damage in the center.
     ++oo   Slime affects all squares it oozes over.  The number of squares is
         equal to the number of charges used, multiplied by _s_l_i_m_e_f_a_c_t_o_r as set
         by huntd(6) (default 3).
     ++oo   One small mine and one large mine are placed in the maze for every
         new player.  A mine has a 2% probability of tripping when you walk
         forward on to it; 50% when going sideways; 95% when backing up.
         Tripping a mine costs you 5 points or 10 points, respectively.  De-
         fusing a mine is worth 1 charge or 9 charges, respectively.
     ++oo   You cannot see behind you.
     ++oo   Cloaking consumes 1 ammo charge per 20 of your moves.
     ++oo   Scanning consumes 1 ammo charge per (20 x the number of players) of
         other player moves.
     ++oo   Turning on cloaking turns off scanning -- turning on scanning turns
         off cloaking.
     ++oo   When you kill someone, you get 2 more damage capacity points and 2
         damage points get taken away.
     ++oo   Maximum typeahead is 5 characters.
     ++oo   A shot destroys normal (i.e., non-diagonal, non-door) walls.
     ++oo   Diagonal walls deflect shots and change orientation.
     ++oo   Doors disperse shots in random directions (up, down, left, right).
     ++oo   Diagonal walls and doors cannot be destroyed by direct shots but may
         be destroyed by an adjacent grenade explosion.
     ++oo   Slime goes around walls, not through them.
     ++oo   Walls regenerate, reappearing in the order they were destroyed.  One
         percent of the regenerated walls will be diagonal walls or doors.
         When a wall is generated directly beneath a player, he is thrown in a
         random direction for a random period of time.  When he lands, he sus-
         tains damage (up to 20 percent of the amount of damage already
         sustained); i.e., the less damage he had, the more nimble he is and
         therefore less likely to hurt himself on landing.
     ++oo   Every 30 deaths or so, a `?' will appear.  It is a wandering bomb
         which will explode when it hits someone, or when it is slimed.
     ++oo   If no one moves, everything stands still.  But see the _s_i_m_s_t_e_p con-
         figuration variable in huntd(6)
     ++oo   The environment variable HUNT is checked to get the player name.  If
         you don't have this variable set, hhuunntt will ask you what name you
         want to play under.  If you wish to set other options than just your
         name, you can enumerate the options as follows:
               setenv HUNT name=Sneaky,team=1,cloak,mapkey=zoFfGg1f2g3F4G
         sets the player name to Sneaky, sets the team to one, sets the enter
         game attribute to cloaked, and the maps zz to oo, FF to ff, GG to gg, 11 to
         ff, 22 to gg, 33 to FF, and 44 to GG.  The mmaappkkeeyy option must be last.  Oth-
         er options are: ssccaann, ffllyy, nnoobbeeeepp, ppoorrtt==_s_t_r_i_n_g, hhoosstt==_s_t_r_i_n_g, and
         mmeessssaaggee==_s_t_r_i_n_g -- which correspond to the command line options.
         String options cannot contain commas since commas are used to sepa-
         rate options.
     ++oo   It's a boring game if you're the only one playing.

     Your score is the decayed average of the ratio of number of kills to num-
     ber of times you entered the game and is only kept for the duration of a
     single session of hhuunntt.

SSTTAATTIISSTTIICCSS
     The --SS option fetches the current game statistics.

     Two groups of statistics are presented: the first group of statistics is
     that of the clients currently connected to the game, and is reset each
     time the client rejoins, while the second group of statistics is on all
     players (dead or alive) by name, and collected over the lifetime of the
     game daemon.

     The meaning of the column headings are as follows:
     Score         the player's last score
     Ducked        how many shots a player ducked
     Absorb        how many shots a player absorbed
     Faced         how many shots were fired at player's face
     Shot          how many shots were fired at player
     Robbed        how many of player's shots were absorbed
     Missed        how many of player's shots were ducked
     SlimeK        how many slime kills player had
     Enemy         how many enemies were killed
     Friend        how many friends were killed (self and same team)
     Deaths        how many times player died
     Still         how many times player died without typing in any commands
     Saved         how many times a shot/bomb would have killed player if he
                   hadn't ducked or absorbed it
     Connect       current connection state(s) of player: `p' for playing, `m'
                   for monitoring
