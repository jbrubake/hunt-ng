on SDF (alpha machines running NetBSD):
    frequent fflushing of the p_output is causing lags. I'm not sure exactly
    what the problem is. This now only happens when there is alot of activity
    (bullets moving, explosions rolling etc). It is still annoying. We also
    still have many unnecessary flushes, flushing only REFRESH commands. It
    should be possible to reduce these, though my first attempt to do so led
    to unpleasant freezes.

GCC 3.2.3 segfaults with -O2 (on my machine anyway)
    When someone gets killed.
    Not tested other compilers yet.
    This bug *was* introduced by me.
    According to gdb, the bug is related to NULL messages. Presumably
	optimisation means code gets executed in an unexpected order, perhaps
	leading to messages being sent before they are actually fully created?

huntd gets SIGPIPE when a client quits
    But only if it's run under gdb!
    Not a clue what's going on really...
	We do appear to write to a dead socket in this case, but then we
	always have and the bug is new (seems to have been introduced along
	with colour, or soon prior)

monitors can't communicate

man pages need updating

with -Drounds=1, typing messages is annoyingly slow.
    Only solution would be to move the message composition code to the client,
    and send the line to the server in one go when it's finished. This would
    blatantly be cleaner anyway.
