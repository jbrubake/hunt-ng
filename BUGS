huntd gets SIGPIPE when a client quits
    But only if it's run under gdb!
    Not a clue what's going on really...
	We do appear to write to a dead socket in this case, but then we
	always have and the bug is new (seems to have been introduced along
	with colour, or soon prior)
monitors can't communicate
man pages need updating
with -Drounds=1, typing messages is annoyingly slow.
    Only solution would be to move the message composition code to the client,
    and send the line to the server in one go when it's finished. This would
    blatantly be cleaner anyway.
