GCC 3.2.3 segfaults with -O2 (on my machine anyway) when someone gets killed.
    This bug *was* introduced by me.
    Seems fine 4 years later with GCC 4.1.2.
    According to gdb, the bug is related to NULL messages. Presumably
	optimisation means code gets executed in an unexpected order, perhaps
	leading to messages being sent before they are actually fully created?

On SDF (alpha machines running NetBSD):
    frequent fflushing of the p_output is causing lags. I'm not sure exactly
    what the problem is. This now only happens when there is alot of activity
    (bullets moving, explosions rolling etc). It is still annoying. We also
    still have many unnecessary flushes, flushing only REFRESH commands. It
    should be possible to reduce these, though my first attempt to do so led
    to unpleasant freezes.

    Remark (2010): above notes made in 2005; I haven't tested to see if it
    still applies.
