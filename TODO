Configuration:
    ~/.huntrc (instead of/as well as $HUNT)
Team play:
    auto-team balancing (join team with least members)
Otto:
    be less stupid
    team play
    handicap
Messaging system:
    allow monitors to type messages.
    with -Drounds=1, typing messages is slow, and lag leads to missing chars.
	Only solution would be to move the message composition code to the
	client, and send the line to the server in one go when it's finished.
	This would blatantly be cleaner anyway.
Misc:
    replays!
Silly suggestions I'm never going to implement:
    a graphical client
