./configure
(cd hunt && make && sudo make install)
(cd huntd && make && sudo make install)

Note that the configure script is not a proper configure script, by any means.
If you have to change anything to get this to compile (I would not be at all
surprised), please tell me (mbays@sdfpau.org) what.
